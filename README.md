# CS 848 (Winter 2024)
# Disaggregated and Heterogeneous Computing Platform for Graph Processing

+ **Instructor:** [M. Tamer Ã–zsu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/)
+ **Seminar Room:** DC 2585
+ **Seminar Time:** Tue 1:30pm-4:30pm

## Overview
There is significant interest in using hardware accelerators for data management. Most of the work has focused on GPUs, but there is interest in the use of FPGAs as well. In parallel, there is research on disaggregated architectures. Initially the focus was on disaggregated storage (most cloud data centres now deploy disaggregated storage), but now disaggregated memory is being investigated. This course will consider the design space when both of these lines of research are combined to develop a disaggregated and heterogeneous platform. The design space is large, so to focus our attention, we will focus on graph workloads.

The course is based on weekly paper readings and student presentations, discussions, and
a term project. 

## Course Logistics

+ Weeks 1 and 2: I will be presenting some background material to set the stage. There are background reading materials for this section and I expect you to read them and be prepared to discuss (see below for details).

+ Weeks 3-In the subsequent weeks, we will spend the class time in paper presentations and discussions. Each week will be two paper presentation and discussions. Each student will present one paper and the presentations will be about 45 minutes. The presenter is expected to investigate the necessary background and present that as well as the paper. Then we will have a discussion.


## Workload Breakdown
