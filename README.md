# CS 848 (Winter 2024)
# Disaggregated and Heterogeneous Computing Platform for Graph Processing

+ **Instructor:** [M. Tamer Ã–zsu](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~tozsu/)
+ **Seminar Room:** DC 2568
+ **Seminar Time:** Tue 1:30pm-4:30pm

## Overview
There is significant interest in using hardware accelerators for data management. Most of the work has focused on GPUs, but there is interest in the use of FPGAs as well. In parallel, there is research on disaggregated architectures. Initially the focus was on disaggregated storage (most cloud data centres now deploy disaggregated storage), but now disaggregated memory is being investigated. This course will consider the design space when both of these lines of research are combined to develop a disaggregated and heterogeneous platform. The design space is large, so to focus our attention, we will focus on graph workloads.

The course is based on weekly paper readings and student presentations, discussions, and a term project. 

## Course Logistics

+ Weeks 1 and 2: I will be presenting some background material to set the stage. There are background reading materials for this section and I expect you to read them and be prepared to discuss (see below for details).

+ Weeks 3-10: These weeks, we will spend the class time in paper presentations and discussions. Each week will be two paper presentation and discussions.

+ Weekd 11-13: Brief project presentations (see below)


## Workload Breakdown (Tentative and might change depending on class size)
+ Presentation: 15%
    + Each student will present one paper in class, critique it, and answer questions from the class. The presentation should be about 45 minutes.
        + If the class size is small, we will have two presentations per student, in which case I will increase the presentation percentage to 20%
    + This talk is supposed to be an in depth description and analysis of the paper. Make sure you read and understand the paper fully as well as any background you need. The presentations should not be hand-waivy but deep and instructive demonstrating that you have fully understood all aspects of the paper.
    + Please submit the presentation slides by 7pm on the Monday prior to your presentation.
    + See the [schedule][https://github.com/ozsu/cs848-w2024/blob/main/Schedule.md] that we will fill as we go through the term.
    + See below for submission of presentation slides.
+ Paper Reviews: 20%
    + All students will read the two papers that will be presented each week, and will write a review of the paper to have submitted a review for two of them (of the student's choice) by 7pm on Monday before the lecture.
    + Each review should be no longer than 1000 words -- that is about 2 pages in 12pt font.
    + See [these guidelines][Reviews.md] for writing the reviews.
    + See below for submission of your reviews.
+ Class participation: 15%
    + Participation in the discussions in class.
    + Since this is a seminar course, this discussion is very important. The expectation is that everyone in class will participate.
+ Project: 50%
    + Done in groups of two.
    + Each group needs to find a topic to research and write a report.
    + See [here][Project.md] for further details

## Weekly Schedule
See the schedule [here][Schedule.md]. Please note that we might adjust it as needed depending on class size.

## Submission of Course material
* I have set up a dropbox folder for you to drop things ; drop everything here.
* Everything should be submitted in PDF format.
* Please name your files as follows: &lt;week_no&gt;-&lt;last_name&gt;-&lt;type&gt;&lt;number&gt;.pdf where &lt;type&gt; is either "review" is for paper reviews or "slides" is for presentation slides when it is your turn; &lt;number&gt; is the paper number.
