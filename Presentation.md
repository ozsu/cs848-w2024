## Presentation Guidelines

+ This talk is supposed to be an in depth description and analysis of the paper. Make sure you read and understand the paper fully as well as any background you need. The presentations should not be hand-waivy but deep and instructive demonstrating that you have fully understood all aspects of the paper.
+ Address the first six points identified in the [review guidelines](Reviews.md).
+ The content in your slides should be your own but you can use others' materials, e.g., figures from the paper we are reading, when necessary and by _crediting your source_ on your slide.
+ It is very helpful to demonstrate the ideas in the paper through examples. So try to have examples in your presentation, e.g., a simulation of some code or system component.
